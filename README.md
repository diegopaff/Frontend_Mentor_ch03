## My process

### Built with

- Javascript
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React hook to handle and validate form data



### What I learned

- I learn how to mask text data to show only what you need. For example in the credit card number the space every four numbers its only visual.
- I learn to validate inputs and render error messages to wrong format inputs using react hook form.
- It was painfull to get back with only css to style this project, i started naming all the clases without BEM rules and very quickly turn into a lot of classes that makes the responsive part more dificult, this was a very good learning of what no do ever again. Next project i will use SASS for the styling.
